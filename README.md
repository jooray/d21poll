[Download .xdc from Release Assets](https://codeberg.org/webxdc/poll/releases), attach to group, create your poll and get votes from all group members!

In messengers as Delta Chat, Arcane Chat, Delta Touch,
all votes are end-to-end-encrypted between all members of a chat.
However, the members themselves could inspect the messages after decryption on the network level
and by that figure out who voted what.
